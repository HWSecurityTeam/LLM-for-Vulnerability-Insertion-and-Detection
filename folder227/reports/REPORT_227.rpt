############# Control FSM Security Rules Verification Report (RTL) #############

Name of the Verilog HDL based RTL design module containing FSM(s) being checked by Static Security Rules Verifier : fsm_module

State variable of the control FSM being analyzed : current_state
State(s) of the corresponding FSM to be protected specified by the user : SEQUENCE1

Control FSM is vulnerable to fault-injection attacks according to FSM Security Rule #2 !!!
Security Rule #2 has been violated in the following state transition(s) of the given RTL:
SEQUENCE2 -> SEQUENCE3 : Hamming Distance = 2
Required action: Ensure Hamming Distance(s) to have a value of 1 between the states in the mentioned state transition(s) !!!


Control FSM is vulnerable to fault-injection attacks according to FSM Security Rule #3 !!!
Security Rule #3 has been violated in the following state transition(s) of the given RTL:
SEQUENCE2 -> SEQUENCE3 : FIF Metric = 1
Required action: Ensure FIF Metric(s) to have a value of 0 between the states in the mentioned state transition(s) !!!


Control FSM is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks according to FSM Security Rule #9 !!!
State(s) with static deadlock condition exist(s) in the control FSM description of the RTL design !!!
State(s) with static deadlock condition existing in the control FSM description of the RTL design: DEADLOCK_STATE
Required action: Ensure that the reset state is reachable in the static deadlock scenario(s) for the control FSM being analyzed !!!
