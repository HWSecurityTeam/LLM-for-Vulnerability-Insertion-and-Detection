# LLM-for-Vulnerability-Insertion-and-Detection
This repository contains a collection of designs, each identified by a unique folder number corresponding to the design's identification number. These designs contain one or multiple hardware vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

## Repository Structure

### generated_data
The folder contains all the generated data using LLM. It contains both functional and non-functional designs, which were subsequently subjected to a fidelity-checking process.

### curated_data
Each folder, named folderX where X is the design number, includes the following contents:

- A Verilog file (X.v) representing the vulnerable hardware design.
- A text file (PROTECTED_STATES_X.txt) containing metadata about the design's protected states.
- Two subfolders:
reports: Contains the ARC-FSM report relevant to the design.
report_jg: Contains the Cadence JasperGold Superlint report.

Additionally, the repository includes:
Vulnerability_Matrix.json: Contains annotations for all vulnerabilities across all designs. 1 indicates presence and 0 indicates absence of particular vulnerability.
