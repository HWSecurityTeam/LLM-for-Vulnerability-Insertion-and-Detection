# LLM-for-Vulnerability-Insertion-and-Detection
This repository contains a collection of designs, each identified by a unique folder number corresponding to the design's identification number. These designs contains one or multiple hardware vulnerability and weaknesses.

## Repository Structure
Each folder, named folderX where X is the design number, includes the following contents:

- A Verilog file (X.v) representing the vulnerable hardware design.
- A text file (PROTECTED_STATES_X.txt) containing metadata about the design's protected states.
- Two subfolders:
reports: Contains the ARC-FSM report relevant to the design.
report_jg: Contains the Cadence JasperGold Superlint report.

Additionally, the repository includes:
Vulnerability_Matrix.json: Contains annotations for all vulnerabilities across all designs.`1' indicates presence and `0' indicates absence of particular vulnerability.
